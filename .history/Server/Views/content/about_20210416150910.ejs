            This is Muzhda Ehsan, a 2nd year student at Durham College in Computer Programming Analyst program. I chose this field since it is very interesting and I like to code. 
            One of my biggest wishes is to have my own software company. I am a hard working person and I have developed my interpersonal skills through these courses.
